# Weight

This mod adds stamina expenditure and recovery penalty, as well as additional fatigue build-up, both of which scale with the weight the character carries. The goal is to produce a realistic interaction between loot, gear, carried weapons, and the character's physical capacity.

The aim of the mod is to encourage players to pick their gear based on weight in addition to functionality and encumbrance. This model of exertion, if appropriated by the base game, should encourage more-realistic modelling of items and their physical dimensions.

This version of the mod is intended for the **0.H** stable release.

## Status

This mod is **playable**.

The numbers should now be at a realistic level. This means lighter loads have a minuscule effect on stamina drain (so small, you're unlikely to notice it), while medium-to-heavy loads will affect stamina and weariness significantly.
