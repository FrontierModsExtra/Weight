# Weight

This mod adds stamina expenditure and recovery penalty, as well as additional fatigue build-up, both of which scale with the weight the character carries. The goal is to produce a realistic interaction between loot, gear, carried weapons, and the character's physical capacity.

The aim of the mod is to encourage players to pick their gear based on weight in addition to functionality and encumbrance. This model of fatigue, if appropriated by the base game, should encourage more-realistic modelling of items and their physical dimensions.

This version of the mod is intended for the **0.H** stable release.

## Status

This mod is **playable** and **in testing**. While the initial idea has been established successfully, numbers may require tweaking. Additionally, ideally, this mod would further integrate with the game, by introducing further interactions with the weightâ€”stamina system for existing traits and conditions.
